When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Using a remote repository is a better idea than having everything stored locally
    because you know your files are safe on cloud storage in case something happens
    to your computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually seems like a better idea because you're in control
    of what will be in your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are used when you would like to clone a repository you found on
    GitHub to edit yourself. Clones are used when you would like to simply get
    a repository for personal use. Branches are groups of commits separated by
    whatever purpose they're needed for.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can easily compare your local repository to the one stored on GitHub.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would most likely work on my projects with a small group of people at the
    same time. That way, we could communicate our thoughts and ideas even more
    quickly.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
